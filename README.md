## Project Requirements:
1. **Interactive Navigation Menu:**
    - Create a responsive navigation menu that reacts to user actions, providing an engaging and interactive experience.

2. **Dynamic Styling:**
    - Implement dynamic changes in color or style based on user interactions:
       - **Scrolling:** Alter the menu's appearance as the user scrolls down the page.
       - **Hovering:** Modify the menu's style when a user hovers over a menu item.

3. **Fixed Position:**
    - Ensure the navigation menu maintains a fixed position on the screen, remaining visible as the user scrolls through different sections of the website.

4. **Visibility on All Pages:**
    - Guarantee the navigation menu's consistent visibility on all pages, providing a seamless and accessible navigation experience.

5. **Use of Technologies:**
    - **HTML:** Structure the navigation menu using HTML, incorporating the necessary elements to represent menu items.
    - **CSS:** Style the navigation menu, defining initial appearances and specifying styles that change during user interactions.
    - **JavaScript:** Integrate JavaScript for interactivity, detecting scrolling events and user hover actions, and triggering corresponding changes in the menu's appearance.

6. **Specific Interactivity:**
    - Utilize JavaScript to dynamically alter menu aspects, such as background color and font color, enhancing the visual appeal and responsiveness.

## Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **HTML Structure:**
    - Develop the HTML structure for the navigation menu, encompassing the required HTML tags for menu items.

2. **CSS Styling:**
    - Define initial styles for the navigation menu using CSS, including styles to be modified during user interactions.

3. **JavaScript Interactivity:**
    - Implement JavaScript code to detect scrolling events and user hover actions.
    - Develop functions for dynamically changing the background color and font color based on detected events.

4. **Testing:**
    - Conduct thorough testing on different pages to ensure the navigation menu remains fixed, consistently visible, and responds appropriately to scrolling and hovering.

5. **Refinement:**
    - Fine-tune styles and interactivity based on testing results, ensuring the code is clean, well-documented, and optimized for performance.

This project will not only enhance the aesthetics of Prodigy InfoTech's website but also improve user engagement and navigation experience through the implementation of an interactive and visually appealing menu system.
